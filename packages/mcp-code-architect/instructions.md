# MCP Code Architect

## Overview

The MCP Code Architect is a tool that generates detailed implementation plans based on code context and custom instructions. It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to communicate between the client and server, and leverages Claude AI (via Anthropic API) to analyze code and generate intelligent implementation plans.

## How It Works

1. The client sends code context and custom instructions to the server
2. The server processes the request and sends it to Claude AI
3. Claude AI analyzes the code context and custom instructions
4. Claude AI generates a detailed implementation plan
5. The server returns the implementation plan to the client

## Implementation Details

The MCP Code Architect consists of:

1. **Server**: Handles requests from clients, communicates with Claude AI, and returns implementation plans
2. **Client**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for developers to interact with the Code Architect
3. **Examples**: Demonstrates how to use the Code Architect in real-world scenarios

## Usage

```javascript
import { CodeArchitectClient } from '@monsoft/mcp-code-architect';

// Create a client
const codeArchitect = new CodeArchitectClient();

// Connect to the server
await codeArchitect.connect();

// Generate an implementation plan
const result = await codeArchitect.generateImplementationPlan(
    codeContext,
    customInstructions,
);

// Use the implementation plan
console.log(result.implementationPlan);

// Disconnect when done
await codeArchitect.disconnect();
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 16 or higher
- Anthropic API key
